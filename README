These classes should be copied to you're SuperCollider extensions library in order to be used.

The PhexEnv class will not function in any version of SuperCollider other than the DEVELOPMENT version availaible on GitHub due to a dependancy on recent changes to the EnvironmentRedirect class. It will not version in 3.6.5/6. Unfortunatly you may need to build this yourself.

For instructions on use see the included PDF.
